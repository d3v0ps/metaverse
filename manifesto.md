# Manifesto

## Power for the people

We truly believe in the Open Source as a way to give more freedom and power to the people. For that reason, we will keep the core of our Metaverse System open.

## Community-driven development

We'll offer the tools so anyone can develop new ways to contribute to the system.

## Integrity as a sign of identity

We won't sell your data ever, and you will always have the chance to keep your data locally so you don't depend on anyone.

## Eco-friendly

We will try to offer the most ecologic solution based on the technologies available as long as they don't conflict with the other points.
