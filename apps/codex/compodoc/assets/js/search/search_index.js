Metaverse\nFirst off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ❤️\nAll types of contributions are encouraged and valued. See the Table of Contents for different ways to help and details about how this project handles them. Please make sure to read the relevant section before making your contribution. It will make it a lot easier for us maintainers and smooth out the experience for all involved. The community looks forward to your contributions. 🎉\n\nAnd if you like the project, but just don't have time to contribute, that's fine. There are other easy ways to support the project and show your appreciation, which we would also be very happy about:\n\nStar the project\nTweet about it\nRefer this project in your project's readme\nMention the project at local meetups and tell your friends/colleagues\n\n\n\nTable of Contents\n\nCode of Conduct\nI Have a Question\nI Want To Contribute\nReporting Bugs\nSuggesting Enhancements\nYour First Code Contribution\nImproving The Documentation\n\n\nStyleguides\nCommit Messages\n\n\nJoin The Project Team\n\nCode of Conduct\nThis project and everyone participating in it is governed by the\nThe Central Factory's Metaverse Code of Conduct.\nBy participating, you are expected to uphold this code. Please report unacceptable behavior\nto <>.\nI Have a Question\n\nIf you want to ask a question, we assume that you have read the available Documentation.\n\nBefore you ask a question, it is best to search for existing Issues that might help you. In case you have found a suitable issue and still need clarification, you can write your question in this issue. It is also advisable to search the internet for answers first.\nIf you then still feel the need to ask a question and need clarification, we recommend the following:\n\nOpen an Issue.\nProvide as much context as you can about what you're running into.\nProvide project and platform versions (nodejs, npm, etc), depending on what seems relevant.\n\nWe will then take care of the issue as soon as possible.\n\n\nI Want To Contribute\n\nLegal Notice \nWhen contributing to this project, you must agree that you have authored 100% of the content, that you have the necessary rights to the content and that the content you contribute may be provided under the project license.\n\nReporting Bugs\n\nBefore Submitting a Bug Report\nA good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up for more information. Therefore, we ask you to investigate carefully, collect information and describe the issue in detail in your report. Please complete the following steps in advance to help us fix any potential bug as fast as possible.\n\nMake sure that you are using the latest version.\nDetermine if your bug is really a bug and not an error on your side e.g. using incompatible environment components/versions (Make sure that you have read the documentation. If you are looking for support, you might want to check this section).\nTo see if other users have experienced (and potentially already solved) the same issue you are having, check if there is not already a bug report existing for your bug or error in the bug tracker.\nAlso make sure to search the internet (including Stack Overflow) to see if users outside of the GitHub community have discussed the issue.\nCollect information about the bug:\nStack trace (Traceback)\nOS, Platform and Version (Windows, Linux, macOS, x86, ARM)\nVersion of the interpreter, compiler, SDK, runtime environment, package manager, depending on what seems relevant.\nPossibly your input and the output\nCan you reliably reproduce the issue? And can you also reproduce it with older versions?\n\n\n\n\nHow Do I Submit a Good Bug Report?\n\nYou must never report security related issues, vulnerabilities or bugs to the issue tracker, or elsewhere in public. Instead sensitive bugs must be sent by email to <>.\n\n\n\nWe use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:\n\nOpen an Issue. (Since we can't be sure at this point whether it is a bug or not, we ask you not to talk about a bug yet and not to label the issue.)\nExplain the behavior you would expect and the actual behavior.\nPlease provide as much context as possible and describe the reproduction steps that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own. This usually includes your code. For good bug reports you should isolate the problem and create a reduced test case.\nProvide the information you collected in the previous section.\n\nOnce it's filed:\n\nThe project team will label the issue accordingly.\nA team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps. If there are no reproduction steps or no obvious way to reproduce the issue, the team will ask you for those steps and mark the issue as needs-repro. Bugs with the needs-repro tag will not be addressed until they are reproduced.\nIf the team is able to reproduce the issue, it will be marked needs-fix, as well as possibly other tags (such as critical), and the issue will be left to be implemented by someone.\n\n\n\n\nSuggesting Enhancements\nThis section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion for The Central Factory's Metaverse, including completely new features and minor improvements to existing functionality. Following these guidelines will help maintainers and the community to understand your suggestion and find related suggestions.\n\nBefore Submitting an Enhancement\n\nMake sure that you are using the latest version.\nRead the documentation carefully and find out if the functionality is already covered, maybe by an individual configuration.\nPerform a search to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the existing issue instead of opening a new one.\nFind out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince the project's developers of the merits of this feature. Keep in mind that we want features that will be useful to the majority of our users and not just a small subset. If you're just targeting a minority of users, consider writing an add-on/plugin library.\n\n\nHow Do I Submit a Good Enhancement Suggestion?\nEnhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues.\n\nUse a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the suggestion.\nProvide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement in as many details as possible.\nDescribe the current behavior and explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why. At this point you can also tell which alternatives do not work for you.\nYou may want to include screenshots and animated GIFs which help you demonstrate the steps or point out the part which the suggestion is related to. You can use this tool to record GIFs on macOS and Windows, and this tool or this tool on Linux. \nExplain why this enhancement would be useful to most The Central Factory's Metaverse users. You may also want to point out the other projects that solved it better and which could serve as inspiration.\n\n\n\nYour First Code Contribution\n\n\nImproving The Documentation\n\n\nStyleguides\nCommit Messages\n\n\nJoin The Project Team\n\n\n\nAttribution\nThis guide is based on the contributing-gen.
