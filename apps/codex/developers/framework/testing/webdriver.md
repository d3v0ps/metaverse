[WebDriver](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver/) is a specification for a browser automation API. 
It's a remote control interface that enables introspection and control of user agents. 
It provides a platform- and language-neutral wire protocol as a way for out-of-process programs to remotely instruct the behavior of web browsers.

This project uses [WebDriverIO](https://webdriver.io/) as the tool to interact with the browser. It is a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) library that provides a high-level API for interacting with a browser.
