# Using the Portal

The easiest way to access to the Metaverse is to use the Metaverse Portal. The portal is a web application that allows you to create an avatar and manage your data from many services.
For another ways to interact with the system, see the [integrations](integrations) page.

You can download the portal from [the public Metaverse github repository](https://central-factory/metaverse/releases?q=portal). There's also a "lite" version deployed on the web, please be aware that it's not fully functional and can have very low local storage limits.

In order to access to the Metaverse you need first own an avatar. [Create it with the Portal](creating-an-avatar).
