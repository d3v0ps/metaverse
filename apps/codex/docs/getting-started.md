# Getting Started

In order to access the Metaverse you need to use applications.

Popular applications are:

- [Portal](https://central-factory.com/metaverse/download-portal)
- [Portal Lite*](https://central-factory.com/metaverse/portal)

\* Portal Lite is a lightweight version of the Portal application. It has less features and some limitations.

Future plans include:

- 3D Portals
- Simulations
- Elaborated Bots
- Deep Customization

The easiest way to get started is to use the [Portal](using-the-portal).
