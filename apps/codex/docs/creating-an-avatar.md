# Creating an Avatar

In order to access to the Metaverse you need first own an avatar. So let's create it.

Avatars are free and private by default, being stored locally on your device and sharing it with others through the [Foundation's Metaverse Network](https://metaverse.central-factory.com). You can change those parameters within the settings menu.

Official Networks:

* [Metaverse](https://metaverse.central-factory.com)
* [Metaverse Test](https://metaverse.central-factory.com/test)
* [Sandbox](https://metaverse.central-factory/sandbox)


After choosing a name and your network and storage preferences, you can start designing your avatar.
The avatar designer is compound of many different parts, depending on the scopes your avatar will have access to. There are many predefined groups of scopes called "roles" you can use to customize your avatar's defaults.

* Some popular roles are:
  * Human Avatars (such as User, Player, Character, Citizen...)
  * Virtual Avatars (such as Agent, NPC...)

Popular avatars are available in the [Metaverse Marketplace](https://metaverse.foundation/marketplace).
